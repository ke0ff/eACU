ErsatzACU - Audio Control Unit

This is a small control unit for my HF/VHF/UHF mobile installation.  It is intended as a stepping-stone to the full-up ACU design that is not-ready-for-prime-time.

The controller uses a TM4C123GH6PM MCU to communicate with the HFB (HF-Bridge), LEDU (LED Unit), and KPU (Key-Pad Unit).
